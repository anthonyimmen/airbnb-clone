# Airbnb Clone Project
Welcome to the GitHub repository of my Airbnb Clone Project! This project is a React Native application designed to simulate the core features of the popular accommodation booking platform, Airbnb. As a developer already experienced in React, I embarked on this project to deepen my understanding of React Native and to explore its capabilities in building cross-platform mobile applications.

## Project Overview
The Airbnb Clone allows users to browse listings, view listings through the map, view detailed pages for each property, and user authorization. This project aims to provide a seamless user experience similar to the original Airbnb app, with a focus on clean design and smooth navigation.

## Technologies Used
* React Native: Used for building the main application framework and UI components.
* Expo Navigation: Handles navigation between the different screens of the app.
* Clerk: Used for authentication and profile information

# Features
Here are some of the key features implemented in this clone:
* User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and log out.
* Listing Browsing: Users can browse through various property listings.
* Search and Filters: Enhanced search functionality to filter listings by type, price, and other parameters.
* Property Details: Detailed view of properties including photos, descriptions, amenities, and booking options.

## Challenges Faced
One of the main challenges was adapting the React knowledge I already possessed to the mobile development environment provided by React Native. This included understanding the different layout and styling principles in a mobile context and integrating mobile-specific libraries and APIs.

## Future Improvements
Going forward, I plan to implement more advanced features such as:
* Map Selection: Ability to select a listing from the Map View
* Search functionality: Being able to search for a specific listing from all listings
* Listing Filtering: Allowing users to filter the listing by using the filter button or the filter tabs
* User Reviews: Allowing users to post reviews on properties they have stayed in.
* Payment Integration: Implementing a secure payment system for booking properties.
